### Intro to Java basics!

Hello my name is Christian Ramos and I am here to talk about the intro to Java or Java basics as I call it. We are learning how to build lines of code for our starter 
for what we have learned so far. The things we want to aim and talk about will be listed down below.

In Java our two first codes we have learned is ```System.out.print("")``` and ```System.out.println("")``` these two codes codes are a method to print something out:

So if I wanted to say System.out.print(" Chris is the best ") the code will print out:

Chris is the best

Both of these methods are used frequently and every assignment and quiz and in java in general!
