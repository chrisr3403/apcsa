### Intro to Java basics!

Hello my name is Christian Ramos and I am here to talk about the intro to Java or Java basics as I call it. We are learning how to build lines of code for our starter 
for what we have learned so far. The things we want to aim and talk about will be listed down below.

In Java our two first codes we have learned is system.out.print("") and ```system.out.println("")``` these codes  are a data structure very similar to ArrayLists in end-result functionality, but very different in how they take up memory in the computer. Here's my current understanding of the difference:
* ArrayLists are effectively glorified Arrays that take up contiguous space in memory. While Arrays are fixed in size, ArrayLists essentially use an "end" marker in an Array with extra space for more elements. When all of the extra space is used, elements are copied over to a new Array (behind the scenes). But the main point is that all data must be back-to-back in memory.
* LinkedLists are very different in that the values in a list can live in completely different/disconnected places in memory. We call them "nodes", where each node has the data, and a connection to the next node which could be anywhere.
