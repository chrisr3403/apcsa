### Intro to Java basics!

Hello my name is Christian Ramos and I am here to talk about the intro to Java or Java basics as I call it. We are learning how to build lines of code for our starter 
for what we have learned so far. The things we want to aim and talk about will be listed down below.

In Java our two first codes we have learned is ```System.out.print("")``` and ```System.out.println("")``` these two codes codes are a method to print something out:

So if I wanted to say System.out.print(" Chris is the best ") the code will print out:

Chris is the best

Both of these methods are used frequently and every assignment and quiz and in java in general!

Lets start with a lesson from lesson 1 of intro to java!
First thing we are going to be looking at is the strings!

Each System println will respond to the string scan code. The string corresponds to the system println so you can answer such as questions.
Every time you answer the question the string transfers over via the scan to another system out print.
This was only many of the things I learned. Strings stores text, ints store whole numbers, double stores decimals and boolean stores two values such as true and false.
