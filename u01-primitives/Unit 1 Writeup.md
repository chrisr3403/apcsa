### Intro to Java basics!

Hello my name is Christian Ramos and I am here to talk about the intro to Java or Java basics as I call it. We are learning how to build lines of code for our starter 
for what we have learned so far. The things we want to aim and talk about will be listed down below.

In Java our two first codes we have learned is ```System.out.print("")``` and ```System.out.println("")``` these two codes codes are a method to print something out:

So if I wanted to say System.out.print(" Chris is the best ") the code will print out:

Chris is the best

Both of these methods are used frequently and every assignment and quiz and in java in general!

Lets start with a lesson from lesson 1 of intro to java!
First thing we are going to be looking at is the strings!

Each System println will respond to the string scan code. The string corresponds to the system println so you can answer such as questions.
Every time you answer the question the string transfers over via the scan to another system out print.
This was only many of the things I learned. Strings stores text, ints store whole numbers, double stores decimals and boolean stores two values such as true and false.

### Challenges!

The first challenge which is very minor is confusing data types. When I first started working on my partner java assignment, it was very easy to confuse data types.
Such as for example a int and a double stores for example numbers. But on a question I had the two codes swapped such as here
   ```System.out.println("Please enter the homework grades for this course.");
        double gradeHW0 = scan.nextDouble();
        double gradeHW1 = scan.nextDouble();
        double gradeHW2 = scan.nextDouble();
        double gradeHW3 = scan.nextDouble();

        System.out.println("Please enter the quiz grades for this course.");
        int quizExam0 = scan.nextInt();
        int quizExam1 = scan.nextInt();
```
So for this it asked for HW grades to be "int" since the hw grades are supposed to show whole numbers. Thinking it was the opposite I thought double is the int same goes for int being the double.
So I used past assignments and also my quiz notes and I noticed it is swapped. So I went to fix it so the int carries the whole numbers and doubles carry desmals.

# My second challenege is figuring out how to actually making int statement scan as in once you enter a whole number it switches. It was simple later on but at first I did not know how to build it properly.
Strings gave me a reference such as ```String coursename = scan.nextLine();``` from my partner assignment. I needed to figure out a way to make it so it had int within so I took the time to make something such as this ```int gradehw0 = scan.nextLine();``` after using this It did not work which got me thinking for hours until I compared all scan line codes to see if they have differences. And one thing I noticed was this part  ```int gradeHW0 = scan.nextInt();``` the part next to the scan method has the "Int" which was needed to make whole numbers and the int code to work.
